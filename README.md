# C-Platformer-Game
The first game I developed from a free course I found on YouTube (VertoStudio3D).
This course introduced me to a lot of the C fundamentals that can be applied outside of game development, but has slowly opened my mind and understanding as to how the language works. I used free sprites I found on the net and drew one of them 'blob.png'. I wanted to learn C before entering C++ and do not regret that decision
